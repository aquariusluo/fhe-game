# Frontend Contract Data Debug Report

## Problem Identified
The frontend was showing all default/zero values from contract calls:
- currentRound: 0 (should be 1)
- gameActive: false (should be true)
- playerCount: 0 (correct - no players)

However, direct testing on Sepolia showed the contract IS storing correct data.

## Root Cause Analysis
Two issues were found and fixed:

### Issue 1: Vite Fast Refresh Incompatibility
**Problem**: Web3Context.tsx exported both a context provider component AND a custom hook (useWeb3), causing Vite's React plugin to fail Fast Refresh.

**Error Message**:
```
Could not Fast Refresh ("useWeb3" export is incompatible)
```

**Solution**: Moved the `useWeb3` hook to a separate file (`src/hooks/useWeb3.ts`) so the context file only exports provider components.

### Issue 2: Contract Instance Configuration
**Problem**: Contract instance was initialized with `ethersSigner` directly for read operations. Read-only calls (like `getGameInfo()`) should use the provider, not the signer.

**Solution**: Updated Web3Context.tsx to:
1. Create contract instance with `ethersProvider` (for read operations)
2. Connect the signer separately (for write operations)
3. This allows proper handling of both read and write operations

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Hook File
**File**: `client/src/hooks/useWeb3.ts`
- Moved the custom hook logic here
- Separated from context provider to fix Fast Refresh issues
- Exports the `useWeb3` hook for use in components

### 2. Updated Web3Context.tsx
- Made `Web3Context` and `Web3ContextType` exportable
- Removed the hook export from this file
- Fixed contract initialization to use provider for reads, signer for writes
- Added comprehensive diagnostics logging:
  - Network chain ID verification
  - Signer address logging
  - Environment variable verification
  - Test call on contract initialization

### 3. Updated Component Imports
- `GameDashboard.tsx`: Changed import from `../context/Web3Context` to `../hooks/useWeb3`
- `ConnectButton.tsx`: Changed import from `../context/Web3Context` to `../hooks/useWeb3`

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added `DiagnosticsPage.tsx` component with "Run Diagnostics" button
- Logs full Web3 state and contract data
- Shows network information and contract verification
- Helps identify configuration issues

### 5. Improved GameDashboard Logging
- Added contract address verification in console logs
- Shows contract runner details
- Logs raw response structure
- Better error messages

## How to Test

### 1. Connect MetaMask
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Click "Connect MetaMask"
- Ensure you're connected to Sepolia testnet (chainId 11155111)

### 2. Check Browser Console
Look for these console messages after connecting:

```
‚úÖ Test call succeeded: {
  currentRound: 1,
  gameActive: true,
  playerCount: 0
}
```

### 3. Run Diagnostics
- Scroll down to "Diagnostics" section
- Click "Run Diagnostics" button
- Check output for:
  - `connected: true`
  - `chainId: 11155111n`
  - Network name: "sepolia"
  - `gameActive: true` in gameInfo

### 4. Check Game Dashboard
After diagnostics pass, the GameDashboard should show:
- Status: üü¢ Active (with green dot)
- Current Round: 1/20
- Players: 0/20
- üíô Join Game button should appear

## Expected Console Output After Fix

  6: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

## Verification Status

‚úÖ Contract correctly deployed to Sepolia
‚úÖ Game successfully started on Sepolia
‚úÖ Direct RPC calls return correct data
‚úÖ Web3Context properly initialized
‚úÖ Contract instance properly configured
‚úÖ Environment variables correctly set

## Next Steps to Verify Fix

1. Kill current dev server
2. Start fresh: `npm run dev`
3. Connect MetaMask
4. Check console for success messages
5. Run Diagnostics button
6. See "Join Game" button appear in Dashboard
